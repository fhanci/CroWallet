### 🛠️ Development Setup (Recommended for Contributors)
However, if you plan to contribute or develop features, it's recommended to set up the environment manually:

#### Start the SQLite web interface

```
docker run --name sqlite-web -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/data:/data ghcr.io/coleifer/sqlite-web:latest /data/database.db
```

#### Then,

- Run `ApiApplication.java` from your IDE
- Launch the frontend:

```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

This setup gives you more flexibility during development and makes debugging easier.
